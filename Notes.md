<h2>(A) What is Emmet?</h2>

<p><strong>Ans.</strong> Emmet gets you code snippets with the help of some unique expressions that are very helpful for some Boilerplate codes and saves typing as well.</p>

<h2>Difference between a Library and Framework</h2>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong>
To answer this we will start with <em>"You tell libraries what to do, frameworks tell you what to do."</em><br>
So a library should be used in a large scale web application where the need is to make the application big so wherever you are going in the application you should use best practices with your code. Small applications don't need framework, it will be more writing the boilerplate codes.
On the other hand libraries are mostly for a single purpose for e.g. React creates UI, Redux handles state management, Jquery provides cross browser dom manipulation, so libraries are built for a single focus but you have 100% control over there you determine how you do it add only the things you need but at a large scale custom functionality can hurt you specially if you are doing it first time
